DESCRIPTION

This patch implements support for the MaxMind geolocation database
(http://www.maxmind.com/app/ip-location) and uses the GeoIP C API.  This
patch was inspired by the patch at (http://www.caraytech.com/geodns/).

The goals for this patch were to implement the City and other MaxMind
databases and add thread safety.

Support is implemented for all relevant MaxMind databases:

	Country
	City
	Region
	ISP
	Organization
	AS number
	Netspeed
	Domain

The Proxy and Accuracy Radius databases are not supported, since they
should be used with the client's IP, not the IP address of the user-local
DNS server (LDNS).

Both threaded and non-threaded operation have been tested.  >100B
production queries have passed through this patch with neither crashes nor
leaks.


SUPPORTED BIND DISTRIBUTIONS

This patch applies cleanly to and has been heavily tested on 9.6.0-P1,
9.6.1, and 9.6.1-P[12].  It also applies cleanly to initial 9.7.0rc
releases.  We currently plan to continue porting the patch to higher BIND
releases, but back-ports for old BIND versions are not planned.


TESTED UNIX DISTRIBUTIONS

This patch has been heavily tested on Ubuntu 8.04 LTS.  Other Linux
platforms should prove equally stable.  While we put significant effort
into the portability of this patch, it has not been tested on
BSD-derivatives, Solaris, other Unixes, or AIX.


INSTALLATION

To build BIND with GeoIP support, you will first need to build/install the
GeoIP C API (linked above).  We recommend 1.4.6 or later; 1.4.5 (at least)
was observed to suffer from memory leaks.

After unpacking the BIND distribution, cd into the untarred directory and
run:

	patch -p0 -b < <path-to-this-patch>/bind-geoip-1.2.patch

This will apply the required patches. You can ignore any conflict on
version, but we recommend you change the RELEASEVER string to denote a
patched version.

	autoconf

(NOTE: patching configure is much less portable than configure.in.  If you
do not have access to autoconf, please let us know and we may provide
patches against configure.)

To add GeoIP support when running configure, there are two key options:

	--with-geoip

This enables support for all functionality.  To enable debug output (when
BIND is passed the appropriate option and logging is enabled) use:

	--with-geoip-debug

Adding the debug logging calls is theoretically a performance hit, but has
not shown to be an issue even in heavy production.  Enabling this is
recommended in case future issues occur that need to be debugged.


CONFIGURATION

GeoIP matches are performed in the BIND match-clients{} clause in a BIND
view.  The match-client{} parameters follow this general pattern:

	geoip_<DBTYPE>DB_<FIELD>_<VALUE>

For values that contain spaces, the '_' character should be used instead.
For timezone values that contain the '/' character, the '|' character
should be used instead.

Note that match-clients{} options are ANDed.  More complex logic must be
obtained with multiple views (ORs) or careful use and solid understanding
of the ! operator.

Some examples:

	# Equivalent to "country_US" in the Caraytech patch:
	geoip_countryDB_country_US;
	geoip_cityDB_city_San_Francisco;
	geoip_cityDB_timezone_America|Chicago;
	geoip_cityDB_country3_JAP;
	geoip_cityDB_regionname_California;
	geoip_cityDB_postal_94118;
	geoip_orgDB_name_Slide;
	# "Square" latitude/longitude area
	geoip_cityDB_lat_41.1_lat_43.1_lon_-82.0_lon_-84.1;
	# Latitudinal "stripe" area
	geoip_cityDB_lat_10_lat_11;
	# Longitudinal "stripe" area
	geoip_cityDB_lon_20_lon_21;
	# Lat/lon radius in degrees (adjusted for tapering longitude at the poles)
	geoip_cityDB_lat_80_lon_83.97_radius_1de;
	# Lat/lon radius in miles (adjusted)
	geoip_cityDB_lat_80_lon_73.97_radius_500mi;
	# Lat/lon radius in kilometers (adjusted)
	geoip_cityDB_lat_80_lon_73.97_radius_100km;

The mechanics of BIND views and other BIND details are beyond the scope of
this document, but the following is an example:

	view "PARIS-FRANCE" {
		match-clients { geoip_cityDB_country_FR; geoip_cityDB_city_Paris; };
		zone "example.com" in {
			type master;
			file "paris.france.example.com.dns";
		};
	};
	# Note this will match ANY city named Paris!
	view "PARIS" {
		match-clients { geoip_cityDB_city_Paris; };
		zone "example.com" in {
			type master;
			file "paris.example.com.dns";
		};
	};
	view "FRANCE" {
		match-clients { geoip_cityDB_country_FR; };
		zone "example.com" in {
			type master;
			file "france.example.com.dns";
		};
	};
	view "GERMANY" {
		match-clients { geoip_cityDB_country_DE; };
		zone "example.com" in {
			type master;
			file "germany.example.com.dns";
		};
	};
	view "DEFAULT" {
		zone "example.com" in {
			type master;
			file "example.com.dns";
		};
	};

Views have precedence -- the first matching view will be used.  LDNS
servers in Paris, FR will see results from the first zone file, and any
other city named Paris will see results from the second zone file.  LDNS
servers in the rest of FR and all of DE will then see their respective
zones, and everyone else will see the final zone file.


STARTUP

Once you install and start BIND, syslog will report something like the
following:

Nov  9 17:07:40 u804 named[20155]: Initializing GeoIP Country DB
Nov  9 17:07:40 u804 named[20155]: GEO-106FREE 20090201 Build 1 Copyright (c) 2007 MaxMind LLC All Rights Reserved

Nov  9 17:07:40 u804 named[20155]: Initializing GeoIP AS DB
Nov  9 17:07:40 u804 named[20155]: GEO-117 20090321 Build 1 Copyright (c) 2007 MaxMind LLC All Rights Reserved
Nov  9 17:07:40 u804 named[20155]: GeoIP NetSpeed DB not available
Nov  9 17:07:40 u804 named[20155]: GeoIP Domain DB not available
Nov  9 17:07:40 u804 named[20155]: running

GeoIP support was able to find the Country, City Rev1, Organization, and
AS databases, but not others.

IMPORTANT NOTE: If you specify a geoip rule in match-clients{} that
reflects an unavailable DB, it will be silently ignored.

If you see a syslog message like:

	error while loading shared libraries: libGeoIP.so.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

This means BIND can't find the GeoIP C API.  You may need to specify its
location via LD_LIBRARY_PATH.


UPDATING THE MAXMIND DATABASES

If you purchase the commercial version of the MaxMind databases (which we
recommend) you can use the MaxMind "geoipupdate" tool to run in-place
updates of the databases.  Alternatively, you can periodically download
updated versions of the free databases.

Simply reload BIND (via "rndc reload" or SIGHUP) and the MaxMind databases
will be reloaded without client impact, and the above messages should be
repeated.

We chose not to use GEOIP_CHECK_CACHE due to the performance hit of a
stat() system call for every lookup.  This also more closely follows the
behavior of BIND, which does not auto-detect changes.

CITY DATABASE OPTIMIZATION

Results from City database lookups are cached for the duration of a query.
City results are represented by a data structure that contains many data
points that could be reused by future City lookups.  For example, the
following would generate two separate GeoIP calls:

	match-clients { geoip_countryDB_country_US; geoip_countryDB_country_FR; };

Whereas this will only generate one call:

	match-clients { geoip_cityDB_country_US; geoip_cityDB_country_FR; };

match-clients{} clauses that contain multiple cityDB lookups are free from
an API perspective.  Also, subsequent sequential DNS requests from the
same LDNS IP can reuse this structure, though this usage pattern is not
common.
